## Recommended practices

- Do the practice assessment a MINIMUM of 5 times
- Basic SQL practice (do this 2 times) -> https://github.com/appacademy/aa10-sql-basics
- practice relationships (do 2 times) -> https://appacademy.instructure.com/courses/334/assignments/18618?module_item_id=59728
- SQL-intermediate querying (do once) -> https://github.com/appacademy/aa10-sql-intermediate


While this may seem like a lot of work, the idea is to learn it the first 2 times and be able to build the muscle memory the next few times so you can fly through any questions you may get on Monday. Remember, you will only have 90 minutes to take the assessment so speed will be your friend. Having to look up information may slow you down, but having these practices completed will set you up really well.
