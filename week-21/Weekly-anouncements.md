Awesome job on the assessment!

The next one will be a little harder, so make sure to review express from week 19, week 21, and week 22!! DO YOUR HOMEWORK!

If you feel yourself struggling at any point over the next 2 weeks, ask for help! You may pass the test, but if you are lost on anything you may end up failing the project coming up after the test.
