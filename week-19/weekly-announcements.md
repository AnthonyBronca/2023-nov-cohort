# Proper Pairing


One of the benefits you get from App Academy is that you are in an environment that enforced pair programming. This is a useful skill that is often used industry wide as it helps with learning and debugging processes. It also helps enforce the use of Git and github workflow to work seamlessly with other developers on differing devices.

We will begin to be more strict with the idea of proper pairing. You should set up a repo with your daily pair, practice adding each other as collaborators, and also be actively driving/navigating. Failure to do proper git workflow and pairing may result in strikes


# Question asking

In section 2 we will be enforcing the use of the discord lecture-questions channel to ask questions. Questions should follow proper question-asking format. You should be able to say what your problem is, what steps you have taken so far, and add any relevant additional information. This is a good way to practice talking about your code in a professional manner, while also practicing what it may be like to ask for help from a senior engineer via email/slack messaging.

Examples of bad questions:

Ex 1:
```
Help in room 1
```

Ex 2:
```
I am running into an error, nothing seems to work. Help
```


Examples of good questions:

Ex 1:
```
I am running into an error that states: "Bad SQL error. Stack trace 123". I tried console.logging some of my data, but I don't seem to be getting anything in my route. Looking it up, I may be doing something bad with SQL but I am not quite sure where to fix my bugs
```

Ex 2:
```
We are currently really close to passing some specs, but for some reason we are getting an error passing the last spec. Our code looks like it should be working, and console.logging the data seems to be printing out the correct output. Adding screenshots for our code and the error we are getting below.
```


# No AI Usage

We understand that some AI tools are out there which may be able to provide results quickly, however, we often find that these are hinderance to learning. Additionally, AI tools can often lead to more bugs and security risks. It is very important for you all to be here to learn the fundamentals, and to master your skills as software engineer in order to get successful careers in this industry. 95% of companies do not even allow AI usage at their companies due to the increase of bugs, inefficient code, hallucinations (code that looks good but is bad), and security risks. The companies that do allow the use of AI, ususally only allow the use of their own proprietary tools. Regardless, software engineers are encouraged to be able to solve their own problems and understand their code and AI tools can limit this learning.

We will be strictly enforcing the no AI usage policy during section 2, both during class and during assessments.
