- Feel comfortable with react errors

    - How do we submit a form
    - How do we handle logic in a form
- Know how to handle navigation
    - How do we use routes
    - How do we set up router
        - (For the Assessment, we will not be using BrowserRouter. Reference PA for how router is wanted on the assessment)
    - How do we navigate
    - How do we have peristant components in all our routes (like a nav bar)
- Feel comfortable with context
    - How do we make contexts
    - How do we wrap our components with context
    - How do we handle state using context
    - How do we grab state items from context within a child component
    - How can child 1 use context to directly effect child 2 without needing to directly talk to the parent (avoiding prop drilling hell)
- Feel comfortable with React Testing
    - We will use Jest, which is what we used on the PA
    - Know how to run the test specs
    - Know how to read the errors



## Tips

- Run the PA 4-5 times. This by far the best way to prepare for Monday. If you do the PA 4 - 5 times, you should easily fly through the assessment on Monday

- Do the Greenhouse practice, especially if you are rust on context (also, remember a/A readmes have a habit of making context harder than they need to be. There are multiple ways to handle passing context to a component)

- Work on the advanced form practice if you are struggling with forms

- Work on the props practice



## Assesment Breakdown

### Assessment Information
Time: 2 hours

Total Specs: 36

Total Points: 54

Passing Score: 43

### Resources
For this assessment, you are allowed to use the following resources:
- a/A curriculum on Canvas
- MDN
- A whiteboard or paper to work out problems/code, but it must be within camera range
- VS Code or a console for coding, testing, and experimentation
- Node
- Postman (when useful)
- Official documentation, including:
- React documentation - https://react.dev/
- React Router documentation - https://reactrouter.com/en/main
- Previously written code you wrote yourself
- Except for code from previous assessment submissions
- Comments within code
- If there are comments in your code about your specific code and about what your code is doing, that is appropriate. If your comments are about concepts and based on the readings, then that counts as notes. Those would not be appropriate.
- You are NOT allowed to refer to any other resources, including--but not limited to--other websites (e.g., StackOverflow), communication apps (e.g., Slack, Discord), search engines, notes, or code from previous assessment submissions.
