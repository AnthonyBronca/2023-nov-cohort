# MOD 5
Welcome to mod 5! We will be learning about a framework called React, as well as a framework called Redux. This mod focuses on building modern single-page application frontends.

## Expectations

DO NOT USE AI. To reiterate what I talked about in mod 4, you all are here to change your careers. You are here to learn, improve, get a job, and become fantastic engineers. Using AI, especially incorrectly (as it often gets abused) typically leads to a weakening of skills. Sometimes we see students get to mod 4 or 5 and they can not even build functions, make for loops, or explain what their code is doing. The more experienced you get the easier it is to tell that code is made with AI. We can tell if you are using it. Additionally, AI usage leads to a lot of security risks. You WILL fail the mod 5 project if you attempt to use AI on it, even just because it does not understand updated code it was not trained on.
